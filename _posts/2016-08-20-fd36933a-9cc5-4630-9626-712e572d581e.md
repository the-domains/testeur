The MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp is a nexus connecting entrepreneurs from around the world to the entrepreneurial ecosystem surrounding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

MIT has opened its doors to entrepreneurs around the world to learn innovation-driven entrepreneurship in the spirit of mens et manus.  
The bootcamp is a mentorship program that begins with a one-week, intensive, in-person training and culminates with a reunion at MIT. This is a highly selective program for highly motivated students. At the last Bootcamp, MIT selected 61 bootcampers out of more than 800 applicants. The selectivity makes for a company of world-class peers.
